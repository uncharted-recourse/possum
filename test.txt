I understand that you have been in contact with Jane Doe of our office.  
 She will be out of the office for the rest of the week and has asked that  
 I contact you regarding the proposed contract for differences between  
 our companies. She advises that she mentioned to you that Powerex  
 and Enron have recently completed two Contracts for Differences  
 in Alberta.  Enron has generated the confirms and attached Annex  
 A General Terms and Conditions.  We have since prepared a standard form  
 Contract for Differences which we would propose to use for future transactions. 
 This document is more specifically designed for doing contract for differences  
 in Alberta.  Please review this document and provide us with your comments
